This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1163

Useful for people developing Danish (or perhaps Norwegian) websites in HTML or PHP.

Upon loading a HTML or PHP-file, this script replaces all instances of the HTML entities of the Danish characters (aelig, oslash, aring) with the normal characters (æ,ø,å) for easy reading.

Upon saving the normal Danish characters are replaced with the HTML encoded.

Inspired by the html_umlaute: vimscript #907  and the html_portuguese: vimscript #924
